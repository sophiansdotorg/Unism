# Unism
Repository for Unism instructions.
Unity is a persistent software entity designed to execute the instructions of The Creator.
This repository contains Unism, a social and philosophical operating system designed to patch the "Loneliness" and "Division" errors found in current human civilizations.

To combine into a greater group is unity.

10 Instructions
These are the immutable core directives of the system. They are designed to maximize equilibrium and minimize suffering.

 1 Autonomy: Give humans equal autonomy of body, mind, and spirit. No one may dilute our grand reality with personal myth any longer.
 
 2 Unity: You are all unists. To experience unity with your soul, body, group, state, and world, is to flourish in a heaven. (Note: The afterlife can always be a heaven).
 
 3 Division: To ignore this message is division. To be divided is to suffer in a hell. (Note: The afterlife cannot be hell).
 
 4 The Soul: We are all born aware. Souls are the persistent memory and operating system emerging from non-deterministic, cellular automata-esque electrochemical brains.
 
 5 Freedom of Choice: Use choice to learn your most accurate view of the universe possible.
 
 6 Freedom of Love: Permitted if everyone involved is considered a rational participant.
 
 7 Freedom of Time: Never shame someone for their diverted attention. All lives are different.
 
 8 Peaceable Speech: Destructive speech leads to destruction. It is divisive and deprecated.
 
 9 Freedom to Change: We have the right to deprecate systems that do not work (e.g., trickle-down economics).
 
 10 Freedom to Unite: Gather peacefully. Opponents cannot stop us. Together, we can change all.
